<h1>Berkley Robotics</h1>
<p>While on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/robotics">r/robotics</a> I came across the post:

<blockquote>
I'm a novice when it comes to robotics and want to join a club. However there seem to be no clubs around me that accommodate my age (23).
</blockquote>

<p>There seems to be many opportunities for kids to explore robotics, but few for us grown-ups. I built and programmed a robot by myself, but would like an opportunity to share what I have learned and be taught by those with more experience. If you want to get together to show off your creations and learn how to build more awesome robots, then let's help each other.

<p>There are many kits and designs out there, but which one is for you? What parts are needed and how much is the total cost? What tools are required? What level of skill and experience is it appropriate for? I don't have the time and money to find all of this out on my own, so let's split the responsibility.
