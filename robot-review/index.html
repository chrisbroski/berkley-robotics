<h1>Robot Reviews</h1>

<p>There are many kits and designs out there, but which one is for you? What parts are needed and how much is the total cost? What tools are required? What level of skill and experience is it appropriate for? I don't have the time and money to find all of this out on my own, so let's split the responsibility.

<p>It's Christmas time, and I hope Santa brings you all the robotic presents you asked for. There are some cool ones out there right now including the <a href="https://shop.littlebits.cc/products/droid-inventor-kit">Star Wars Droid Inventor Kit</a>. I would love to see a demo of what that can do. <a href="https://www.servocity.com/kits/robot-kits">Actobotics Runt Rovers</a> are new kits that are mostly under $30. They look like a good, inexpensive place to start a rover bot, but it's hard to tell which are best for specific applications and what other parts are required for power and computer integration.
