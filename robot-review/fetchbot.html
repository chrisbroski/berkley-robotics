<h2>Parts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Actobotics Kit - Actobitty 2 $29.95
<li>Raspberry Pi 2 $29.99
<li>Raspberry Pi Camera Module $29.99
<li>“Power Bank” battery charger for mobile devices $5.99
<li>Actobotics Pi Channel Mount $1.95
<li>L9110 dual H-bridge ~$3.00
<li>USB WiFi dongle ~$3.00
<li>16GB micro SD card with Raspbian image $7.99
<li>Female to female jumper wires
<li>Male to female jumper wires
<li>Nylon cable ties
<li>Electrical tape
<li>4 AA cells
</ul>

<h3>Total Cost</h3>
<p>About $120.00

<h2>Tools</h2>
<h3>For working with the Raspberry Pi</h3>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi power supply
<li>HDMI monitor
<li>Bluetooth keyboard
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This was my first attempt at building my own robot and it worked, but I spent more money than I wanted. I think the cost could be brought down with a less expensive single-board computer (maybe a Raspberry Pi Zero) and USB camera.

<p>The Actobitty has 2 rear wheels and a single front plastic runner so it is only capable of movement on a smooth, flat surface.

<p>Assembly of the robot is easy - a 12 year old should be able to handle it. Working with the Raspberry Pi is harder. Make sure you have the tools and experience needed for a Pi before you start.
